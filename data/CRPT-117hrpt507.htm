  Add at the end the following:

                TITLE VIII--STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH RIGHTS

SEC. 801. SHORT TITLE.

  This title may be cited as the ``Student Mental Health Rights 
Act''.

SEC. 802. FINDINGS.

  Congress finds the following:
          (1) Nearly all institutions of higher education are 
        subject to--
                  (A) the Americans with Disabilities Act of 
                1990 (42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq.);
                  (B) section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 
                1973 (29 U.S.C. 794); or
                  (C) the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3601 et 
                seq.).
          (2) The laws described in paragraph (1) prohibit 
        discrimination on the basis of disability, defined as 
        ``with respect to an individual, a physical or mental 
        impairment that substantially limits one or more major 
        life activities of such individual, a record of such an 
        impairment, or being regarded as having such an 
        impairment'' under section 3(1) of the Americans with 
        Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12102(1)).
          (3) Under section 2(a)(3) of the Americans with 
        Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12101(a)(3)), 
        Congress found that ``discrimination against 
        individuals with disabilities persists in such critical 
        areas as employment, housing, public accommodations, 
        education, transportation, communication, recreation, 
        institutionalization, health services, voting, and 
        access to public services''.
          (4) The laws described in paragraph (1) prohibit 
        institutions of higher education from discriminating 
        against students with disabilities, including by 
        failing to provide reasonable accommodations or 
        reasonable modifications to such students so that such 
        students are able to fully participate in postsecondary 
        life.
          (5) The laws described in paragraph (1) prohibit 
        institutions of higher education from discriminating 
        against students with mental health disabilities, 
        including by failing to provide reasonable 
        accommodations or reasonable modifications to such a 
        student.
          (6) The vast majority of institutions of higher 
        education lack a comprehensive plan for addressing and 
        preventing discrimination against students with mental 
        health disabilities or who are experiencing crises, in 
        many cases--
                  (A) requiring such students to leave the 
                institution of higher education;
                  (B) evicting such students from on-campus 
                housing; and
                  (C) establishing excessive and unnecessary 
                impediments to the re-enrollment of such 
                students to the institution of higher 
                education.

SEC. 803. STUDY.

  (a) Voluntary Reporting.--Not later than 120 days after the 
date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall solicit 
from students at institutions of higher education information, 
on a voluntary basis, with respect to mental health 
disabilities and substance use disorders at such institutions 
of higher education.
  (b) Requirement.--Not later than 1 year after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall complete a study on

        students under subsection (a), the prevalence of such 
        disabilities and disorders, disaggregated by type of 
        disability or disorder (including hearing difficulty, 
        vision difficulty, cognitive difficulty, ambulatory 
        difficulty, self-care difficulty, independent living 
        difficulty, mental health difficulty, and any other 
        category deemed appropriate by the Secretary), among 
        students at institutions of higher education and 
        policies to support students with respect to such 
        conditions;
          (2) the policies of institutions of higher education 
        with respect to students who, due to such a condition, 
        are considering a voluntary leave of absence or are 
        required to take a mandatory or involuntary leave of 
        absence, or return from such an absence, and compliance 
        by institutions of higher education with such policies; 
        and
          (3) best practices for supporting students at 
        institutions of higher education in managing such 
        conditions, including the effect such practices have on 
        graduation rates and degree completion.
  (c) Report.--The Secretary shall submit to the Committee on 
Education and Labor of the House of Representatives and the

submitted under section 803(b), the Secretary shall, in

Rights Division of the Department of Justice, issue guidance 
on--
          (1) the compliance of institutions of higher 
        education with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 
        1990 (42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq.) and section 504 of the 
        Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794) with respect 
        to students with mental health disabilities;
          (2) the legal obligations of institutions of higher 
        education with respect to accommodating students with 
        mental health disabilities and students with substance 
        use disorders; and
          (3) policies of institutions of higher education

        use disorders.

  Add at the end the following:

       TITLE VIII--OCCUPATIONAL RESEARCH PROGRAM ON MENTAL HEALTH

SECTION 801. OCCUPATIONAL RESEARCH PROGRAM ON MENTAL HEALTH.

  (a) In General.--The Director of the National Institute for 
Occupational Safety and Health (in this section referred to as 
the ``Institute'') shall establish a research program to 
identify and apply comprehensive approaches to support 
frontline, essential, and other affected workers across all 
industries and occupations exposed to and affected by workplace 
stressors that contribute to adverse mental health outcomes, 
including traumatic stress, anxiety, depression, suicide, and 
related mental health conditions. In designing such research 
program, the Director shall, in consultation with the heads of 
other Federal departments and agencies, as appropriate, address 
workplace stressors such as--
          (1) traumatic grief resulting from COVID-19-related 
        death or injury in the workplace;
          (2) conditions of employment or places of employment, 
        including consecutive shifts, increases in shift 
        duration, changes in workplace protocols, or increases 
        in workloads and demands due to insufficient resources, 
        which can result in fatal, near-fatal, or other serious 
        occupational injuries or illnesses; or
          (3) workplace violence or other physical and 
        psychological hazards that contribute to worker injury 
        or illness on the job, including poor mental health 
        outcomes among workers.
  (b) Best Practices and Recommendations.--As part of the 
research program established under this section, the Director 
shall develop best practices or recommendations for 
organizational-level workplace interventions and support 
services that would both prevent worker injury or illness and 
reduce the risk of such adverse mental health outcomes among 
frontline, essential, and other affected workers across all 
industries and occupations, including wraparound services, 
mental health awareness initiatives, workplace stress 
prevention programs, and training programs to promote work-
related stress prevention and reduction and organizational 
resilience, to include specific strategies for preventing 
burnout among workers.
  (c) Additional Support.--As part of such research program, 
the Director shall also coordinate and support efforts through 
other research programs carried out by the Institute, including 
the Institute's Total Worker Health program, to develop 
comprehensive, evidence-informed approaches to support mental 
and behavioral health as a part of worker wellbeing and related 
occupational safety and health programs.
  (d) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date of 
enactment of this Act, the Director shall--
          (1) report to the Committee on Education and Labor of 
        the House of Representatives and the Committee on 
        Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions of the Senate on 
        the extent to which best practices or recommendations 
        developed pursuant to subsection (b) have been adopted 
        by relevant stakeholders; and
          (2) engage in education and outreach activities with 
        employers, health care providers, nonprofit 
        organizations, workers, labor organizations, and 
        related stakeholders to support such adoption.
  (e) Authorization of Appropriations.--To carry out this 
section, there is authorized to be appropriated $10,000,000 for 
each of fiscal years 2023 through 2025.
